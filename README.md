# goldleaf-homebrew

A final project for Bitwise Industry's Web for Beginner. This website represent my hobby and if I were conducting as a business today, what would that website have.

At the landing page, there are two other webpages that the navigation can take the user to - Schedule and Contact. The Schedule acts as both the About page while holds a calender event with lists of brew status of each beer and competition events. For the Contact page, it shows a map of a fictional location of the business and unsubmittable text area form.

What I learn from this project is the fundamental approach used in HTML and CSS. Extra methods I have looked into were importing html features with use of javascripts, further implemented responsiveness with CSS, and utilized Git for version control with .ssh key.
